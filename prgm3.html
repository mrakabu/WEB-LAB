    <h2>Welcome to Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</h2>
    <h3>Exploring the World of Computing and Innovation</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>
      Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is one of the most dynamic and evolving fields of technology. 
      It focuses on the study of algorithms, programming languages, software development, networking, and 
      artificial intelligence. This paragraph demonstrates the styling for the 
      <code>p</code> tag, including font, color, and spacing — all applied to describe how design and structure 
      enhance the presentation of web content.

    <div>
      <p>
        Within the <code>div</code> section, we explore how CSE connects theory and practice. 
        Students learn about data structures, operating systems, and modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, 
        and JavaScript to build interactive and responsive web applications.
      </p>
      <span>
        The <code>span</code> element here highlights key CSE skills — problem-solving, coding efficiency, 
        and innovative thinking — that empower engineers to create smarter systems.
